&lt;p&gt;A few months prior, Papua hadn’t been on my radar. The few things I had heard about the place had mostly discouraged me from visiting. While on Borneo, one of the other Indonesian islands, this view changed as my curiosity was piqued by locals telling me Papuan tales. Among other things, the island was supposedly full of people living in traditional ways. That is to say, I could expect to find natives walking around with their penis gourds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving Papua, it once again dawned on me the difference between what is said about a place and the actual experience of it. They’re usually different. I didn’t arrive Jayapura, the capital of Papua with much of a plan and wasn’t sure what to expect. Thought I a general idea of the type of experience I was seeking which was going to be a people experience. At first, I pursued an idea of visiting a tribe known as the Korowais, infamous for their cannibal practices. I discovered however that it was seriously hard to explore their territory without prior preparations, at least inexpensively. Giving up on that idea, I settled on going trekking in Baliem Valley instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These valleys were accidentally discovered 8 decades ago by a Dutch pilot surveying the area. To his surprise, I imagine, he discovered an agricultural society running alongside the valleys. It was remarkable because it was a Neolithic society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of the valley are good and kind, and today the area is a popular among adventure travelers. After some days spent in the missionary town of Wamena, a seriously Christian place run by white folks, with churches on almost every corner, I put on my shoes and went trekking the valleys. The trek became challenging as the trails were often narrow and I was short on gear, primarily boots and walking poles. Frequent rain didn’t help. On the upside, there was plenty of time to reflect, be amazed and learn about this world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trails run alongside the valleys at different altitudes. Trails made of stone, many made of dirt lead to hamlets and villages. The people are hospitable and kind, but among some, I noticed a begging mentality. It’s hard to know how to behave ethically when visiting vulnerable people like these. Many tourists leave children candies and other things, encouraging them to see visitors as someone to give them things; an attitude no-one benefits from. Other times I noticed entrepreneurial spirits, showing me hand-made products and offering assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/baliem/papua-6.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Stone paths like these run throughout the valley. How many million stones they put down, I don't know. Monumental pieces of work these trails were.&quot;&gt;
